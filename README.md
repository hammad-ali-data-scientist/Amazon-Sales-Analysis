# 📦 Amazon Sales Analysis Project

An end-to-end data analytics project that analyzes Amazon sales data using **Python** for data processing and **Microsoft Azure** for cloud-based data storage and handling. This project demonstrates skills in **data wrangling, visualization, and insights extraction** from real-world e-commerce sales.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores key business insights from Amazon sales data, such as:

- 🛍️ Top-selling product categories
- 📆 Monthly sales trends
- 🌆 Best-performing cities and states
- 💰 Revenue distribution by category

The data was processed using Python and the **Pandas** library, with visualizations created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. Microsoft Azure services like **Azure Blob Storage** and **Azure Data Factory** were considered for scalable data handling.
